# Expenses-Tracker
## How to use
Users and Expenses can be created, updated, and deleted. The app will keep track of important data points, for example, total expenses, total expenses for a given user, and total expenses for a given category.

You can select a user simply by clicking on their name. This will allow you to create new expenses for them, and it will also filter the table to expenses that were created for that user. Click again to unselect that user and unfilter the table. If you have an unwieldy list of users, you can use the search bar to quickly find who you're looking for.

You can change the category filtering by clicking on the dropdown select menu in the top right. This will instantly give you the total expenses in that category and also filter the table below.

These two filtering methods can work in tandem to give you an easy and quick look at specific details.
